This experiment aimed to examine an application of evolutionary robotics techniques. A computational model of a rat exhibiting the aproach/avoidance conflict was obtained. In particular, a genetic algorithm was used to evolve the controller of an E-puck robot within simulation.

The behaviour exhibited by the robot is similar to that of a real rat, though some areas where improvement could be were highlighted.

Further work could be done within the genetic algorithm by modifying the type of selection and crossover used to generate a new population, as well as changing the population and generation size and allowing evolution to progress for longer. In addition, the hardware used by the robot to operate could be evolved. This could be achieved by giving the algorithm access to all available sensors and letting the evolution process select which sensors are best suited. This coud lead to efficiency increases.
