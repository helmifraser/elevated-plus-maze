The elevated plus maze is a widely used experimental apparatus for measuring anxiety in rodents. Historically, it was first used in the 1950s in order to analyse the approach/avoidance conflict in rats exposed to a new environment. More recently, it has been used to test the effects of behaviour modification drugs by observing the movements of the rat before and after exposure.

In this report, a method of developing a computational model to simulate the behaviour of a rodent in this maze is described. This was achieved by using a genetic algorithm to evolve a feed-forward multi-layer perceptron controlling the movements of the robot.
