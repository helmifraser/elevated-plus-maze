	abstract = {To investigate whether an elevated plus-maze consisting of two open and two closed arms could be used as a model of anxiety in the mouse, NIH Swiss mice were tested in the apparatus immediately after a holeboard test. Factor analysis of data from undrugged animals tested in the holeboard and plus-maze yielded three orthogonal factors interpreted as assessing anxiety, directed exploration and locomotion. Anxiolytic drugs (chlordiazepoxide, sodium pentobarbital and ethanol) increased the proportion of time spent on the open arms, and anxiogenic drugs (FG 7142, caffeine and picrotoxin) reduced this measure. Amphetamine and imipramine failed to alter the indices of anxiety. The anxiolytic effect of chlordiazepoxide was reduced in mice that had previously experienced the plus-maze in an undrugged state. Testing animals in the holeboard immediately before the plus-maze test significantly elevated both the percentage of time spent on the open arms and the total number of arm entries, but did not affect the behavioral response to chlordiazepoxide. The plus-maze appears to be a useful test with which to investigate both anxiolytic and anxiogenic agents.},

Briefly, rats or mice are placed at the junction of the four arms of the maze, facing an open arm, and entries/duration in each arm are recorded by a video-tracking system and observer simultaneously for 5 min. Other ethological parameters (i.e., rears, head dips and stretched-attend postures) can also be observed. An increase in open arm activity (duration and/or entries) reflects anti-anxiety behavior. In our laboratory, rats or mice are exposed to the plus maze on one occasion; thus, results can be obtained in 5 min per rodent.},

	abstract = {Background Neuroevolution comprises the use of evolutionary computation to define the architecture and/or to train artificial neural networks (ANNs). This strategy has been employed to investigate the behavior of rats in the elevated plus-maze, which is a widely used tool for studying anxiety in mice and rats. New method Here we propose a neuroevolutionary model, in which both the weights and the architecture of artificial neural networks (our virtual rats) are evolved by a genetic algorithm. Comparison with existing method(s) This model is an improvement of a previous model that involves the evolution of just the weights of the ANN by the genetic algorithm. In order to compare both models, we analyzed traditional measures of anxiety behavior, like the time spent and the number of entries in both open and closed arms of the maze. Results When compared to real rat data, our findings suggest that the results from the model introduced here are statistically better than those from other models in the literature. Conclusions In this way, the neuroevolution of architecture is clearly important for the development of the virtual rats. Moreover, this technique allowed the comprehension of the importance of different sensory units and different number of hidden neurons (performing as memory) in the ANNs (virtual rats).},

It involves three parameters: drive to explore; drive to avoid aversive stimuli; and spontaneous locomotor activity. Each network unit corresponds to a specific location in the maze and the connections, only between closest neighbors, represent the possible adjacent places to which a virtual rat can navigate. Competitive learning is used to generate a sequence of network states that correspond to the virtual rat successive locations in the maze. To evaluate the generality of the model it was also tested for two modifications of the elevated plus-maze: one with totally closed arms and the other with totally open arms. The results are compared with data obtained with rats. The simulations are consistent with experimental evidence and may provide an efficient way of describing the anxiety-like rat behavior in the elevated plus-maze. This could be useful for researching the emotional parameters involved in this anxiety animal model.},

	abstract = {The elevated plus-maze is an apparatus widely used to study the level of anxiety in rodents. The maze is plus-shaped, with two enclosed arms and two open arms, and elevated 50. cm from the floor. During a test, which usually lasts for 5. min, the animal is initially put at the center and is free to move and explore the entire maze. The level of anxiety is measured by variables such as the percentage of time spent and the number of entries in the enclosed arms. High percentage of time spent at and number of entries in the enclosed arms indicate anxiety. Here we propose a computational model of rat behavior in the elevated plus-maze based on an artificial neural network trained by a genetic algorithm. The fitness function of the genetic algorithm is composed of reward (positive) and punishment (negative) terms, which are incremented as the computational agent (virtual rat) moves in the maze. The punishment term is modulated by a parameter that simulates the effects of different drugs. Unlike other computational models, the virtual rat is built independently of prior known experimental data. The exploratory behaviors generated by the model for different simulated pharmacological conditions are in good agreement with data from real rats. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

@book{Fraser1970,
	abstract = {The first computer simulation study in genetics was reported by Fraser, one of the authors of this book, in 1957. Since then, computer techniques have been used to analyse many of the problems in theoretical population genetics in which the mathematics seems intractable. Although there has been a vast output from the computers, the real returns in developments of genetic theory have not been correspondingly large. One might therefore hope that a review of the topic, which would seem worthwhile at this stage, would give direction to research workers' efforts and thereby improve the yield from simulation studies. Unfortunately, the authors fail to do this. When discussing techniques they consider the basic simulation of the genetic process and methods of displaying the output, but do not discuss how existing theory might be used as a base and developed further by the simulation to increase our understanding of the general theory. The reader unfamiliar with computer methods in genetics will be able to use this book to learn the techniques of direct simulation in which the binary bits represent genes. But the coverage of models is restricted: there is no mention of methods of partial simulation, in which some parts of the selection and reproduction process are handled algebraically. However, some of the completely algebraic methods appropriate only for infinitely large populations are described. The book includes an extensive review of the authors' own work, and several topics, notably deviations from optimum and inversion polymorphisms, are studied comprehensively to give a useful structure. The coverage of some other areas is much less satisfactory, particularly the section on finite population size, in which examples of simulation results are given without even mentioning that they can be predicted from existing theory. The computer has considerable application in genetics teaching and a useful discussion on the topic is included. At this level illustrative computer runs chosen for specific parameter values can be worth while. W. G. Hill},

	abstract = {The elevated plus-maze test has been in use as a rodent model of anxiety for a decade, and is representative of those tests that are based upon the study of spontaneous behaviour patterns and which have high ecological validity. The origins of the test in studies of the relationship between exploration and fear are reviewed, and attention is drawn to the distinct possibility that variation in the pharmaco-sensitivity of the procedure may be attributable to often extreme methodological variation between laboratories. In considering further this issue, attention is also drawn to the need to collect data under constant test conditions and to provide the minimum database necessary to reach conclusions regarding the behavioural specificity of drug action. Recent research, which has extended the conventional plus-maze scoring technique to include specific behavioural acts and postures (in particular, those relating to defensive behaviour), is described. The value of such an ethological approach to the plus-maze is then exemplified with original data that demonstrate behaviourally selective, anti-anxiety effects of the Gaba(a) receptor agonist, muscimol (0.125-1.0 mg/kg). It is concluded that, when used appropriately, the elevated plus- maze test can be a very valuable tool in drag screening and in the study of the neurobiology of anxiety and defence. More attention to behaviour and somewhat less emphasis on test simplicity and convenience would seem to be warranted.},

	abstract = {Although the mouse genome is now completely sequenced, the functions of most of the genes expressed in the brain are not known. The influence of a given gene on a specific behavior can be determined by behavioral analysis of mutant mice. If a target gene is expressed in the brain, behavioral phenotype of the mutant mice could elucidate the genetic mechanism of normal behaviors. The elevated plus maze test is one of the most widely used tests for measuring anxiety-like behavior. The test is based on the natural aversion of mice for open and elevated areas, as well as on their natural spontaneous exploratory behavior in novel environments. The apparatus consists of open arms and closed arms, crossed in the middle perpendicularly to each other, and a center area. Mice are given access to all of the arms and are allowed to move freely between them. The number of entries into the open arms and the time spent in the open arms are used as indices of open space-induced anxiety in mice. Unfortunately, the procedural differences that exist between laboratories make it difficult to duplicate and compare results among laboratories. Here, we present a detailed movie demonstrating our protocol for the elevated plus maze test. In our laboratory, we have assessed more than 90 strains of mutant mice using the protocol shown in the movie. These data will be disclosed as a part of a public database that we are now constructing. Visualization of the protocol will promote better understanding of the details of the entire experimental procedure, allowing for standardization of the protocols used in different laboratories and comparisons of the behavioral phenotypes of various strains of mutant mice assessed using this test.},

Through a systematic evaluation by the students, we show that the e- puck fits this purpose and is appreciated by 90 percent of a large sample of students.},

	Abstract = {Giving rats opportunity to explore an enclosed or an elevated alleyway permitted study of exploratory drive in situations arousing different intensities of fear. It was concluded that such novel situations may induce approach avoidance conflict behavior. It was further found that strength of fear drive to novel situations declines as a function of time of direct exposure; after a period of non-exposure, spontaneous recovery of the fear reaction may be observed, "the magnitude of which depends upon the amount of fear extinguished to that stimulation on previous occasions."
