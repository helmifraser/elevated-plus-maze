	Abstract = {Giving rats opportunity to explore an enclosed or an elevated alleyway permitted study of exploratory drive in situations arousing different intensities of fear. It was concluded that such novel situations may induce approach avoidance conflict behavior. It was further found that strength of fear drive to novel situations declines as a function of time of direct exposure; after a period of non-exposure, spontaneous recovery of the fear reaction may be observed, "the magnitude of which depends upon the amount of fear extinguished to that stimulation on previous occasions."
